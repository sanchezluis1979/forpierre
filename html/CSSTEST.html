 <div class="multi">
   After dropping support for several devices last month, what Sony's PlayStation Now streaming service lacks with only two remaining platforms is about to be (somewhat) made up for with a library of newer games, courtesy of the PS4.

   That's right: PS4 games are coming to PlayStation Now. Originally limited to (an actually impressive 480+) PS3 titles, games from Sony's latest console will soon be streamable via PlayStation Now to both PS4 consoles and Windows PCs.



   PS4 game streaming on PlayStation Now works the same as it did on PS3, allowing users to beam a game directly to their machine without the need to buy a disc or digital download that sucks up a third of your hard drive space.

   Cloud saves will also be in place, ensuring players can put down their game and pick things up elsewhere without losing any precious progress.

   Two consoles, one service

   Despite adding a new platform, Sony says both PS3 and PS4 game libraries will be included in a single PlayStation Now subscription, which runs for $19.99/Â£12.99 a month (though you can try before you buy with a 7-day trial.)

   Sadly, there's no mention of exactly when PS4 games are expected to hit PlayStation Now, nor any indicator what games will be available to stream at launch.
